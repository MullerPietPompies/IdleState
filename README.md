# Shader State

An openGL experiment

---

## Background

---

This project started out as a final Homework Assignment for my Computer Graphics course (COS344) in my final year of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. During this project and the course of the module I discovered my love for Graphics Programming and rendering. 
I decided to fork this repo from the original project and treat it as a sandbox where I can play around and expand the project by adding more sofisticated elements. 

I implemented much of the code, lighting and shadow simulation.

## Purpose

---

I will use this repo as a sandbox where I can show and expand my skillset in graphics programming and shaders. 
I chose to use this project because it gave me the same uneasy feeling, I loved, from old Source Engine games.

## Building and Runnung the project

---

For now this project can only be run with Nix using the provided `shell.nix` file

- The next I will add builds for this as time goes on

## Build steps

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Run 
```bash
cd src/
```
3. Run 
```bash 
nix-shell
```
4. Run 
```bash 
make
```

## Running The Program

- After you have completed the Build steps simply run `make run` from the `src/` directory.
